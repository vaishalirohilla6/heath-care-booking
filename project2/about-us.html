            <p>
                Health Care Booking is an online scheduling system that allows individuals to book bed online and appointment through any device, such as a computer laptop etc.<br> Though Bed Management is a core operational activity in all hospitals, many hospitals have problems with it. This seemingly simple activity is anything but that. Few institutions have complete visibility of this process as it weaves its way through the organisation and fewer still have means of measuring the performance of the activity that results in the availability of a bed. Optimizing Bed Management is critical to the efficient functioning of any hospital.This paper proposes a way to analyze, control and optimize this process. </p>
